To automatically check for leaked secrets and apply autoformatting (see .pre-commit-config.yaml), you should install the supplied pre-commit hooks. They are run before each commit.

Install pre-commit via pip
```sh
python -m pip install pre-commit
```

Install the supplied hooks
```sh
pre-commit autoupdate && pre-commit install
```

Run hooks manually
```sh
pre-commit run --all-files
```
